# Bankers-Algorithm-C
This repository implements the Banker's Algorithm in C to address the problem of safe resource allocation in operating systems. It provides functions for:

Calculating the safe sequence of processes that can be executed to completion without causing deadlock.
Simulating resource request scenarios to determine if a request can be granted safely without hindering other processes.
The code includes:

Input/output functions to interact with the user.
Functions to calculate the need matrix based on max and allocated resources.
Implementation of the Banker's Algorithm using a safety check.


This repository serves as a practical example of the Banker's Algorithm and can be used for educational purposes or as a foundation for building more advanced resource management systems.
